# Hello. Is It Me You're Looking For?

I'm Andrew.  
I'm a [Software Engineer](http://www.sleepeasysoftware.com/coder-vs-programmer-vs-software-engineer-vs-architect-vs/) with a passion for [Software Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture).  
I work remotely.  
I care a lot about code design, organization, architecture, and documentation.  
I â™¥ Node.js, Javascript, Great UX, Web Development, the Front End, and tooling with Gulp.

I'm probably on a boat.

### Historical Tidbits

_(This personal site was originally hosted on [shellscape.org](https://shellscape.org))_<br><br>

Shellscape.org has a [history](http://web.archive.org/web/19991012050234/http://shellscape.org/)
rooted in the [Windows Alternative Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_shells_for_Windows) scene from the late 90s. It was originally conceived as a shell news site. When
Windows XP was released and addressed many of the alt-shell enthusiasts' concerns,
the scene all but dried up. The site languished until it was [repurposed](http://web.archive.org/web/20060213075654/http://www.shellscape.org/)
to house free, and later - open source, software projects. It then became my personal website, showcasing open source work and my blog posts. When I decided to open an agency in 2022 named after the site, Shellscape Software, the blog and work showcase moved to this domain.
