I've been working remotely for nearly 7 years now, and I couldn't imagine ever
 going into an office on a daily basis again. It's a magical setup that affords
 incredible freedom, and far more responsibility. I love working remotely, and
 I'm going to share with you my strategy for working in my own, pants-optional
 office.

<!-- more -->

> I could never work from home, I'd never get anything done.

That's the response I typically get from anyone I've ever told about my setup.
I've come to acquire several key lessons and skills that make working remotely a
joy, so much so that I doubt I'll ever again take employment where reporting to
an office is a requirement, if I can at all help it.

## Never Say Never

The "I could never do it" response from folks isn't surprising. The last thing
most of us want to do at home is think about work. In fact,
[many smart types will tell you](https://hbr.org/2016/07/dont-take-work-stress-home-with-you)
that it's an unhealthy thing to do. And for those who work the typical *9 to 5*
routine, I'd probably agree. But I live the software developer life, and I've
come to find a method that makes it very easy to be successful remotely.

## When Work Isn't Work

If work is work, you shouldn't be doing it from home. I'm lucky enough to do something
that I'm fairly decent at, and that which I really enjoy. That's really key.
Enjoying the work lets you turn on and off at will without contaminating your
home with "the office". You'll be able to let ideas flow throughout the day
and night. The official hours of your physical office will become more
guidelines, whereby you need to stay available, but that which you're not
constrained by.

## Pants Are Actually Optional

Just don't forget them if you're planning on taking video conference meetings.
You don't want to be that person that has to get up to shut the window and
inadvertently shows off those new adventurous undies.

But in all seriousness, get comfortable. Choose a workspace that works best for
you. Remember that you're not in an office! I personally choose to work from my
dining table with lots of light and fresh Florida air. Some of my peers prefer
a cordoned off basement office. Your workspace should be what keeps you the most
comfortable throughout the day.

Part of a great workspace is surrounding yourself with things you love. My
kitchen is about 20 feet from my laptop - my inner fat kid loves that. That also
means that I have water and [other beverages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A14qyN0rVGA)
readily accessible. I've also got a solid TV on the wall and typically have
Netflix going all day long. For me, some kind of white noise and the occasional
mental break in close proximity keeps me sane throughout the day.

## Creature Feature

Get a pet! They're an incredible stress reliever and amazing outlet for problem
solving. Don't be afraid to be that crazy person who talks to their animals.

frequently helps me out in a mental bind.

## Communicate, Silly

Communication. Communication. Communication. You must go out of your way to
communicate with your peers, your supervisors, even the person working at the
reception desk in the office. There are reasons, of course:

### Communication Builds Trust

Trust in you from your peers is key, and while it would be grand if we were all
judged by our merits, many people can't trust until there's a base of
communication that's usual and comfortable.

### Communication Builds Rapport

Until you're in the office and have the chance at in-person face time with
everyone you work with, you're the faceless (or single faced avatar) internet
person who apparently gets paid by the same company bi-weekly. You may be fortunate
and work for a company that has access to video conferencing, but even then
you're still a floating head in a window. Great communication builds a
familiarity with your peers that will ultimately aid in collaboration.

### Frequent Communication Creates Value

Frequent communication is paramount. Vanishing for extended stretches of time
has a negative effect. Remember that you're not in the office and people can't
see what you're up to. For all they know you're out at the pool floating on a
giant inflatable swan. When you reach out throughout the day, you're reminding
people that you're there. When you share what you're working on frequently,
you're reminding people of the work you're doing.

## Hellooooooo

Working remotely can sometimes [feel like a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCdRFMp8Xwo)
out of *28 Days Later*. The feeling of isolation is something every remote worker
needs to combat on a daily basis. Sometimes it's a slow day in the office, and
others it's that the physical office is too busy. It's easy in that frequent
situation to get discouraged, frustrated, or just plain bummed out. That's a good
opportunity to step away and right your ship.

Since us remotes are also neglected socializing throughout the day, make up for
that deficit when work is done for the day. I'm a social guy and staying in or
isolated for too long gets me stir-crazy. I make a concerted effort to socialize
after-hours. Befriend some bartenders or others that work outside the 9-to-5
cycle. If you've a family, visit with some neighbors or take the kiddies out for
something fun around other people.

## Halt, and Catch Fire

Take breaks. Take lunches. Take naps. Decline meetings. Run errands. Play with
the dog. Go for a walk. Go for a run. Get a hobby and indulge it. Watch an
episode of *The Walking Dead*. Have an adult beverage if you feel the urge. I
personally never like to work for more than two hours straight. Halting keeps me
fresh and keeps me sane.

Stopping and taking a breath is one of my keys to the gig. Those incredible
freedoms I mentioned earlier come into play here. Of course this depends on the
company you work for and the folks above or around you in the hierarchy, but
take advantage of the ability to do throughout the day what those in an office
aren't able to. Just bear in mind that your responsibility to the work doesn't
end. If you're going to play a little hookey, remember to make time later to
cover your deliverables.

## Expand Your Organizational Skills

When no one's available to chat, you don't always have the luxury of stopping
work and waiting. You'll have to develop solid organizational skills that will
allow you to revisit things that need discussing, or to resume tasks that you're
blocked on down the line. A great degree of self-management is necessary
regardless of the kind of management structure you're working in. A cautious
level of independence will go a long way. You won't always have the time or the
opportunity to discuss choices, problems, or solutions with your peers. Which
brings us to...

## Peer Dependencies

(That's an NPM pun, for the nerds reading this)

Your peers are going to mean success or failure in a remote gig. When
interviewing, make sure you're asking questions as well. You'll want to interview
the folks doing the interviewing to make sure they know how to work with remote
developers. Some companies are freshly wading into hiring remotes, others are
seasoned, and yet others have no idea what they're getting into. Management
should be on board with and see value in remote employees. It also helps to jump
into a gig with peers that have experience working with remotes. Talk to the
folks that will be managing you and your projects to get a feel for how they
expect to work with you. Never be afraid to share your ideas early on.

## Time For a Whisky

I hope that the lessons I've learned can give others in or considering remote
work something to think about and help out if needed.
